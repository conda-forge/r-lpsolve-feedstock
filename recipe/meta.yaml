  summary: Lp_solve is freely available (under LGPL 2) software for solving linear, integer and
    mixed integer programs. In this implementation we supply a "wrapper" function in
    C and some R functions that solve general linear/integer problems, assignment problems,
    and transportation problems. This version calls lp_solve version 5.5.
